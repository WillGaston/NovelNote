# NovelNote
Novel Note is a software project undertaken as part of my Software Design and Development major project for the 2023 HSC.

The primary aim of the ‘Novel Note’ application is to create a user-friendly, ergonomic application that allows the users to keep up with and record information about novels and quotes. The objectives of the application are as follows:
•	Create an interface for users to record novels they’ve read, are reading, or plan to read.
•	Allow users to provide ratings for novels.
•	Allow users to list various quotes, including character and novel source.
•	Create and display relevant statistics from novel data.
